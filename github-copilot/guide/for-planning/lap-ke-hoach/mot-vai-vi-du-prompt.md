| <p><strong>1. Be specific and detailed</strong></p><p>The more specific your prompts are, the more accurate and useful the suggestions Copilot generates will be. Vague prompts often result in generic responses, whereas detailed prompts provide context that Copilot can leverage to deliver precise recommendations.</p> | Instead of asking, “Generate a project plan for an e-commerce site,” try, “Generate a project plan for an e-commerce site that includes user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and payment gateway integration.” |
| <p><strong>2. Break down tasks</strong></p><p>Dividing large tasks into smaller, manageable parts allows Copilot to focus on each component, yielding more precise suggestions for each task.</p>                                                                                                                             | When planning a new feature, break it down into smaller tasks like “Generate a plan for implementing user registration and login,” followed by “Generate a plan for adding product catalog management.”                                                 |
| <p><strong>3. Use step-by-step instructions</strong></p><p>Guiding Copilot through tasks with step-by-step instructions helps maintain a logical flow in the generated plan.</p>                                                                                                                                              | “Create a step-by-step plan for integrating a third-party payment gateway, starting with researching APIs, setting up sandbox accounts, and testing transactions.”                                                                                      |
| <p><strong>4. Incorporate examples and context</strong></p><p>Providing specific examples and context within your prompts enables Copilot to better understand the nuances of your project and generate more relevant suggestions.</p>                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
