# 👋 Loa phường!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Lời nói đầu:** Đây là câu chuyện bịa do tác giả tự nghĩ ra, mọi sự trùng hợp chỉ là ngẫu nhiên. Truyện cũng có khá nhiều từ ngữ không đứng đắn, lỗ bỗ, xã giao. Là lúc trà đá, chém gió giữa 2 bạn SE, 1 già, 1 trẻ, Bình Ruồi và Lâm Chồn. Câu chuyện xoay quanh chủ đề "Defensive Programming" (Lập trình phòng thủ).
